    // To make a widget, make a Python file in the `widgets` directory.
    // The file's name (excluding `.py`) is what the widget will be called.
    // The file must contain a class named `Widget`, which must have a method named `Get()`.
    // `Get()` will be provided no arguments, but should return something that can be converted to a string, this is the value of the widget.
